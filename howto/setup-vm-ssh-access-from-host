To setup ssh access into a VM that is running on your machine:

1. Setup the VM instance.
2. In the network settings, click on "port forwarding".
3. In the rules, add the host port that you want to have forwarded to the VM.
4. In the rules, add the guest port (in this case, the VM instance) to be 22 (the default ssh port).
5. That's it! You can now do two things:
  - On the host the you can connect to the VM using ssh and the port that you put in.
  - From a remote machine, you can ssh using the port that you put. This will ssh you directly into
    the VM instance.
