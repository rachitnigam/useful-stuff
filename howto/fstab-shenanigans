Fixing partition issues
----------------------

- This morning, my laptop refused to hibernate properly; everytime I closed
  the lid, the device completely shut down.
- On a separate note, about a month ago, I resized my home partition by
  moving the swap partition. Since after the move, every startup would hang
  for a while saying that a start job is running.

The Issue
---------

- The issue was that that swap partition information in `/etc/fstab` and
  `/etc/default/grub` was no updated properly by GParted.
- To figure the issue out, I ran `blkid` which give the UUID for the swap
  partition. I then ran `grep resume /boot/grub/grub.cfg`. The UUIDs for
  swap were different. I updated `/etc/defaults/grub` with the correct
  UUID and ran `update-grub` to regenerate boot information.
- This didn't solve the problem. Eventually, I found that the swap information
  in `/etc/fstab` was also incorrect. Turns out that this file overwrites the
  information found by `systemd` at boot time.
- On updating `/etc/fstab` and rebooting, both the problems were solved.
